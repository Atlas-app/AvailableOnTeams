# Available On Teams

Sometimes the system expects you to be active even when you’re working quietly. So I built a tiny helper that keeps the lights green while I focus on the real stuff.
This utility is designed to simulate periodic mouse activity in order to keep Microsoft Teams in an “Available” (green) state.
After installation, the application starts by minimizing all open windows, positioning the cursor at the center of the screen, and then performing continuous, automated mouse movements and clicks. 
The behavior is subtle, lightweight, and fully automatic, ensuring the system remains active without user intervention. 

## Instructions

- Download the latest release from the [Releases] page. 
- Once installed, launch the "Available On Teams" application. 
- The application will run minimized in you traybar. You can toggle its activity by clicking on the tray icon with the right mouse button and choosing "Start" or "Stop". 
For easier access, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + A` to start the application and `Ctrl + Alt + S` to stop the application.

## Development instructions

To build and run the "Available On Teams" application from source, follow these steps:

- Build the project using your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Publish the project to create an executable file.
- Run the generated executable to start the application (or use Inno Setup to create an installer).

## Requirements
- Windows Operating System

## TODOs:

- [ ] set custom interval time and movement distance
- [ ] add howto section with screenshots in the website
